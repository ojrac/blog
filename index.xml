      <description>I was looking for information on creating static mesh assets in Unreal from C++, and found a blog post that covered exactly that&amp;hellip; in version 4.16. I was working on an editor plugin for Unreal 5.0.1, and there were a few changes needed before it would compile.
Before I get into what I had to change, here&amp;rsquo;s the sample; it creates a pyramid shape from a set of vertices with positions and UVs, and lets Unreal compute the normals and tangents.</description>

      <title>OpenSimplex Noise in Go</title>

      <description>NOTE: As of early 2022, the Simplex noise patent has expired. Still, the opensimplex-go repo&amp;rsquo;s test case .json is a convenient starting point for anyone who needs to write a new opensimplex implementation.
 One of my Go projects uses procedurally-generated terrain â€” which means I want smooth random noise. Perlin noise is a common choice, and there are existing Go implementations, but Perlin noise suffers from axis-aligned artifacts. Ken Perlin&amp;rsquo;s successor to Perlin noise (Simplex) fixes those problems, but adds a worse one: it&amp;rsquo;s patented.</description>
