    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> As of early 2022, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6867776B2/en">the Simplex noise
patent</a>
has expired. Still, the opensimplex-go repo&rsquo;s test case .json is a convenient
starting point for anyone who needs to write a new opensimplex implementation.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of my Go projects uses procedurally-generated terrain — which means
I want smooth random noise. Perlin noise is a common choice, and there are
existing Go implementations, but Perlin noise suffers from axis-aligned
artifacts. Ken Perlin&rsquo;s successor to Perlin noise (Simplex) fixes those
problems, but adds a worse one: it&rsquo;s patented. Thankfully, there&rsquo;s an
alternative: <a href="http://uniblock.tumblr.com/post/97868843242/noise">OpenSimplex noise by Kurt
Spencer</a>. I couldn&rsquo;t find a
Go version, so I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://github.com/ojrac/opensimplex-go">ported OpenSimplex noise to
Go</a>, and released it under the same
<a href="http://unlicense.org/">Unlicense</a> as the OpenSimplex algorithm.</p>
<p>Besides getting the code to compile and look basically right, my goal
was to get identical output to the reference implementation — ideally,
regardless of platform. My first attempt at testing was to render and compare
greyscale PNGs of the noise. That caught the first few glaring bugs, but it
failed at the larger goal of correctness: I was crushing 64-bit floats into a
tiny color channel.</p>
<p>I needed to preserve all 64-bits of the inputs and output. I also wanted less
uniform test samples and a wider range of input, in case there were subtle bugs
masked by the regular interval and all-positive numbers. For the second pass, I
generated 2048 samples per dimension, randomly choosing coordinates in
[-1000, 1000] from the reference implementation.</p>
<p>Now that my test failures were in terms of <code>float64</code>s, I found my final
bug: everything was off by around 0.00000000001. The problem was with my very
first choice when porting — high-precision Go constants.</p>
<p>The OpenSimplex Java code starts with a few lines like this:</p>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>I jumped at the chance to reevaluate the functions and pile on as much
precision as I could. Go distinguishes itself from most languages with
high-precision compile-time math, but this port needs consistency across
platforms and languages. Restoring the original constants, and comparing
the <code>float64</code> output from the Java version with <code>==</code>, the tests passed.</p>
<p>I have two long-term goals for this code: testing on other architectures (to
look for floating-point math surprises), and benchmarking. It can take a lot of
samples of noise to generate a procedural scene, so speed is important; It&rsquo;s
also an opportunity to get more experience with Go&rsquo;s built-in benchmarking
tools. Even without those improvements, I think this code is still useful
enough to publish; OpenSimplex is great for anyone who wants higher quality
than Perlin noise, but isn&rsquo;t willing to deal with patents.</p>
